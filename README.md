# HOUSE_PRICE_PREDITION
Author: (EJ) Vivek Pandey
LilHomie is a rapid prototyping project that aims to generate housing appraisals to determine values of properties in the New York Tri-state Area.

This repository contains all the associated work that has been done for the area which includes:

Web Crawler to gather housing data
Notebooks associated with data engineering, EDA, and ML Modeling
Serverless API setup to make predictions off the serialized models
Web App
Future Enhancements
Adding support to crawl and extract through remaining 3 property page formats in Trulia
Spiders in Web Crawler to extract data from Zillow
Speeding up the crawler with distributed spiders
Feeding the ML model with data of properties across the US and making necessary adjustments based on new results, instead of the tri-states properties it is limited to (but this requires the above three enhancements to be done first)
